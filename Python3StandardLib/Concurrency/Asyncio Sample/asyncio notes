# an event loop essentially manages and distributes the execution of different tasks. It registers them and handles distributing the flow of control between them.

# Coroutines are special functions that work similarly. Python generators that on await release the flow of control back to the event loop.
# Coroutine needs to be scheduled to run using the event loop.To do this ,create a task which is a type of future.

# Futures are objects that represent the result of a task that may or may not have been executed.
